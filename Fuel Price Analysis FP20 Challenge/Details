<b> Background Information
This project delves into Argentina’s fuel market dynamics over the past few years. Analyzing data from government databases and fuel companies, it explores trends and fluctuations in fuel prices for different types (gasoline, diesel, alternatives) and sellers across various regions.

The goal is to uncover patterns like price adjustments, seasonal variations, and regional discrepancies. By leveraging clear data analysis, the project aims to reveal the key drivers affecting fuel prices without resorting to complex statistical methods. Ultimately, it seeks to provide a comprehensive picture of how fuel prices behave throughout Argentina.
